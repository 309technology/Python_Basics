    "### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "- Python has a simple syntax.\n",
    "- Python is an Interpreted Language:\n",
    "    - That means an interpreter is used to parse any program you write, one line at\n",
    "a time. With compiled languages, such as the C languages, a compiler is used\n",
    "to compile the code before it is executed.\n",
    "Interpreted computer languages are a little slower than compiled languages\n",
    "and don’t offer the performance benefits of compiled languages. However,\n",
    "the latter are too difficult and complicated for complete beginners to learn,\n",
    "and they require you to write every function, even the most basic ones.\n",
    "- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n",
    "- Dynamically Typed\n",
    "    - Unlike compiled languages, with Python, there is no need to define the data\n",
    "type of a variable before you need it. Python can infer it automatically based\n",
    "on the value type in the variable.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    <b>For example:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "            myvar = \"Good Morning Python.\"\n",
    "In the above code line, we have a variable called `myvar`, and a string of\n",
    "“Good Morning Python” is assigned to it. That means `myvar` has a data type\n",
    "of a string.\n",
    "- Strongly Typed\n",
    "Python does not allow automatic conversions of data types. For example,\n",
    "1 + “2” would result in an error in Python\n",
    "- Less Code = More Achievement\n",
    "Python uses less code to achieve what other programs do; for example, it\n",
    "uses around one-third or one-fifth less code than Java.\n",
    "For example, you need only two lines of code to read Python files:\n",
    "\n",
    "`f = open(\"myfile.txt\") `\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(f.read())`\n"
